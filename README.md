# Computaion-of-the-eigenvalues-eigenstates-and-saturated-gain-rate-of-oligomer-PT-symmetric-system
This Matlab code is available for the paper entitled, "Wide-range robust wireless power transfer using heterogeneously coupled and flippable neutrals in parityâ€“time symmetry".  It computes the eigenvalues, eigenstates, and saturated gain rate of an oligomer PT-symmetric system.
